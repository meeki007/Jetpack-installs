## Jetpack-installs

Howto's for building, making, and installing packages for jetpack.
Currently this howto assumes you have ***Jetpack 4.6.1*** installed. This may work with other versions. However you will have to sort your own dependency issues that pop up.


### Python

[Install python 3.9.12 or other python version with altinstall](./python/python.MD)

This will show you how to altinstall a python version, so to not replace your default Python3 that came with jetpack.

### openCV
[Install openCV 4.5.5 or other openCV version](./openCV/openCV.MD)

This will show you how to install openCV to a altinstall of python or your default Python3 that came with jetpack.
